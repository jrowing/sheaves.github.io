This blog is powered by [**Sage**](http://www.sagemath.org/), [Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/)   and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), based on a theme from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com).

It is my collection of sample Sage code that can be run directly in your browser.

Read more [about the Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/static/about.html), including how to embed runnable Sage code into your website.
