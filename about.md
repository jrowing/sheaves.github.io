This blog is powered by [**SageMath**](http://www.sagemath.org/){:target="_blank"}, the [Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/){:target="_blank"}   and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll){:target="_blank"}, based on a theme from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com){:target="_blank"}.

It's my collection of SageMath code that can be run directly in your browser.

Read more [about the Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/static/about.html){:target="_blank"}, including how to embed executable Sage code into your website. Or [fork](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start){:target="_blank"} this  [repository](https://github.com/sheaves/sheaves.github.io){:target="_blank"} on Github to get started right away! 

To get even more Sage power (with lots more fancy stuff like privacy settings, collaboration,... basically your own Sage server), sign up for a free [**SageMath Cloud**](https://cloud.sagemath.com/){:target="_blank"} account! Or [download and run a local copy](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html){:target="_blank"} of Sage.

Here are more resources for computing with Sage:

  - [**Quick reference cards**](http://wiki.sagemath.org/quickref){:target="_blank"}: Reference cards to help get you started in Sage. Includes cards for linear algebra, number theory, graph theory, calculus and abstract algebra. In other languages as well!
  - [**Documentation**](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/index.html){:target="_blank"}: Includes a quick tutorial, as well as a full reference manual.
  - [**Interactive examples**](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/){:target="_blank"}: This page contains lots more examples, from various fields of math and science.
  - [**Ask Sagemath**](http://ask.sagemath.org/questions/){:target="_blank"}: Get answers to Sage-related questions here.
