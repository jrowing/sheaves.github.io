I've been participating in the [Kan Extension Seminar II](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/kanII/), and this week it's my turn to post about Jon Beck's "Distributive Laws" at the [n-Category Cafe](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)!

The post uses lots of string diagrams for monads, resulting in pictures like the following:
