I've been away from this blog for quite a while - almost a year, in fact! My excuses are my wedding and the prelims (a.k.a. QUALs), as well as all the preparation that had to go into them (although, to be honest, those things only occupied me till September last year!). 

Looking back at my previous posts, I've realized that in attempting to teach *both* math and code, I probably ended up doing neither. This is really not the best place to be reading about representation theory (for example) for the first time - there are better books and blogs out there. Also, most of the code that I wrote to illustrate those posts feels contrived, and neither highlights Sage's strengths nor reflects how I normally use Sage for my assignments and projects.

I've thus decided to write shorter posts with code that I've actually used (in private, on [SageMathCloud](https://cloud.sagemath.com/){:target="_blank"}), with some explanations of the code. Lately, I've been writing code for non-commutative algebra and combinatorics, so today I'll start with a simple example of a non-commutative algebra.

## The Weyl Algebra
Fix a field $\mathbb{F}$ and consider its polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}[x]$. Then multiplication by $x$ and differentiating w.r.t. $x$ are both linear operators on $\mathbb{F}[x]$. Let $m_x$ and $\partial_x$ denote these operators. The algebra generated by them is the (1-dimensional) **Weyl Algebra**.

For any $f \in \mathbb{F}[x]$, applying the chain rule gives
$$
\partial_x (x f(x)) = x \partial_x(f(x)) + f(x),
$$
which we may rewrite as
$$
\partial_x \circ m_x = m_x \circ \partial_x + 1.
$$
Thus the Weyl algebra can be thought of as the free algebra in two generators $m_x, \partial_x$ subject to the relation $m_x \partial_x = \partial_x m_x -1$.
