This is a sample post. It can be viewed [here](http://sheaves.github.io/Sample-Post/){:target="_blank"}. The URL of the post depends on the part of the filename that comes after the date. If you change the filename, the URL of this post will change as well.

It's probably best to copy this file into a new post, instead of editing this directly, so that this can serve as a future reference.

## Front matter

To make this post your own, change the following things:

  - **Filename**: Filenames should be of the form `YYYY-MM-DD-Title-of-Post.md`. As mentioned above, changing the filename causes the URL of the post to change.
  - **Title**: Self-explanatory
  - **Tags**: You can create your own tags, or use [existing ones](http://sheaves.github.io/topics){:target="_blank"}.
