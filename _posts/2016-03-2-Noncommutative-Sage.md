title: Noncommutative Algebras in Sage
draft_tag: 
- Noncommutative Algebra
---

In this post, I'll demonstrate 3 ways to define non-commutative rings in Sage. They're essentially different ways of expressing the non-commutative relations in the ring:

  1. [Via `g_algebra`](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/free_algebra.html#sage.algebras.free_algebra.FreeAlgebra_generic.g_algebra){:target="_blank"}: define the relations directly
  1. [Via `NCPolynomialRing_plural`](http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.html){:target="_blank"}: define a pair of structural matrices
  1. [Via a quotient of a letterplace ring](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/quotient_ring.html){:target="_blank"}: define the ideal generated by the relations (only works for homogeneous relations)

As far as I know, all 3 methods rely on Sage's interface with [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php){:target="_blank"} and its non-commutative extension [Plural](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_469.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

In addition to all the documentation linked above, I also relied heavily on  Greuel and Pfister's [*A Singular Introduction to
Commutative Algebra*](http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/archivesecoles/20130130100834/singularbuch1-210.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Despite the title, it does have a pretty substantial section (1.9) devoted to non-commutative $G$-algebras.

## $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ and its homogenization

The running example throughout this post will be the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. This is the (non-commutative) $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $U$ with generators $e,f,h$ subject to the relations

$$
[h,e] = 2e, \qquad [h,f] = -2f, \qquad [e,f] = h.
$$

If we put $e,f,h$ in degree 1, these relations are not homogeneous. Their left-hand sides all have degree 2, while the right-hand sides have degree 1. This won't be a problem with the first two methods, but won't work for method 3, which requires homogeneous relations.

To demonstrate the third method, we'll define the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra $H$ with generators $e,f,h,t$ subject to the relations

$$
[t,h] = [t,e] = [t,f] = 0,
$$

$$
[h,e] = 2et, \qquad [h,f] = -2ft, \qquad [e,f] = ht.
$$

We can obtain $U$ both as a quotient and a localization of $H$:

$$
H/(1-t) \cong U \cong H[t^{-1}]_0.
$$
