title: Noncommutative Algebras in Sage
draft_tag: 
- Noncommutative Algebra
---

In this post, I'll demonstrate 3 ways to define non-commutative rings in Sage. They're essentially different ways of expressing the non-commutative relations in the ring:

  - Via [`g_algebra`](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/free_algebra.html#sage.algebras.free_algebra.FreeAlgebra_generic.g_algebra){:target="_blank"}: define the relations directly
  - Via [`NCPolynomialRing_plural'](http://www.sagemath.org/documentation/html/en/reference/polynomial_rings/sage/rings/polynomial/plural.html){:target="_blank"}: define a pair of structural matrices
  - Via a quotient of a [letterplace ring](http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/quotient_ring.html){:target="_blank"}: define the ideal generated by the relations (only works for homogeneous relations)

As far as I know, all 3 methods rely on Sage's interface with [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/index.php){:target="_blank"} and its non-commutative extension [Plural](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-0-2/sing_469.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

In addition to all the documentation linked above, I also relied heavily on  Greuel and Pfister's [*A Singular Introduction to
Commutative Algebra*](http://www.cimpa-icpam.org/archivesecoles/20130130100834/singularbuch1-210.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Despite the title, it does have section devoted to non-commutative $G$-algebras.
