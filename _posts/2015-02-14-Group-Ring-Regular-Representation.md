In the [previous post]({% post_url 2015-02-02-Representation-Theory-Decomposing-Representations%}){:target="_blank"}, we saw how to decompose a given group representation into irreducibles. But we still don't know much about the irreducible representations of a (finite) group. What do they look like? How many are there? And is there even a finite number of irreducible representations?

In this post, we'll construct the [group ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_ring){:target="_blank"} of a group. Treating this as a vector space, we get the [regular representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_representation){:target="_blank"}, which turns out to contain *all* the irreducible representations of $G$!

## The group ring

Given a (finite) group $G$ and a field $F$, we can treat each element of $G$ as a basis element of a vector space over $F$. The resulting vector space generated by $g \in G$ is

$$
FG := \left\{\sum_{g\in G} \alpha_g g: \alpha_g \in F \right\}.
$$

"Vectors" in FG are added component-wise:

$$
\left(\sum_{g \in G} \alpha_g g\right) + \left(\sum_{g\in G} \beta_g g\right) = \sum_{g \in G} (\alpha_g+\beta_g) g.
$$

Let's do this is Sage with the group $G = D_4$ and the field $F = \mathbb{Q}$:

*(The Sage cells in this post are linked, so things may not work if you don't execute them in order.)*

<div class="linked">
  <script type="text/x-sage">
G = DihedralGroup(4)
F = QQbar

FG = GroupAlgebra(G,F)

v = FG.an_element()
w = FG.random_element()

print 'v = ' + str(v)
print 'w = ' + str(w)
print 'v + w = ' + str(w + v)
  </script>
</div>

In fact this is a *ring*, because we can also multiply "vectors" by using the multiplication rule of the group $G$

$$
\left(\sum_{h \in G} \alpha_h h\right) \left(\sum_{g\in G} \beta_g g\right) = \sum_{h,g \in G} (\alpha_h+\beta_g) hg.
$$

<div class="linked">
  <script type="text/x-sage">
print 'v * w = ' + str(w * v)
  </script>
</div>
