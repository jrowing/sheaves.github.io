This is the first in a series of posts on visualizing groups via their [lattice of subgroups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_of_subgroups).

One way of getting a better understanding of a group is by considering its subgroups. The lattice of subgroups (more precisely, the [Hasse diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram) of this lattice) gives us a way to visualize how these subgroups relate to each other and to their parent group.
