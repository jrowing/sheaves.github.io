## Liang Ze Wong <img align="right" src="/images/photo.jpg" width="150" />

I am a third-year [math](http://www.math.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} PhD student at the University of Washington, Seattle. My advisor is [James Zhang](https://www.math.washington.edu/~zhang/){:target="_blank"}.

My current interests are in category theory and Hopf algebras. Specifically, I'm interested in monads, monoidal categories, bicategories, and manifestations of Hopf-algebra-type structures in such categories. I've also recently begun learning about model categories and $\infty$-categories.

I used to write simple snippets of code for this site, mostly in Python/Sage. Nowadays, I spend more time playing around with string diagrams. If I have enough time and motivation, I might post some stuff about string diagrams here someday.

### Misc.
