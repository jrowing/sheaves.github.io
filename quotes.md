> You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down again. So why bother in the first place? Just this: What is above knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is above.

> I like to imagine abstraction (abstractly ha ha ha) as pulling the strings on a marionette. The marionette, being "real life," is easily accessible.

> ... 
> Imagine it gets worse. Much, much worse. Imagine that the marionettes we see are controlled by marionettoids we don't see which are in turn controlled by pre-puppeteers which are finally controlled by actual puppeteers.
> ...
> I spent years trying to fake puppeteer lingo, but I have officially given up. My goal here is to write
something that I can understand and remember and talk about with my non-puppeteer friends and family,
which will allow me to speak my own language to the puppeteers.
