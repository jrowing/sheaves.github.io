This is a compilation of dedications and acknowledgments that have caught my eye. They're mostly from math books.

> I wish to thank Prof. Pavel Etingof and his co-authors for adding technical notes to my historical monograph. While they have made a commendable effort at a concise exposition, their notes, unfortunately, have grown in size and in the end occupied a better part of this volume. I hope the reader will forgive this preponderance of technicalities in what, in essence, is a history book.

Slava Gerovitch, in a footnote, *Introduction to Representation Theory* by Pavel Etingof et al.
