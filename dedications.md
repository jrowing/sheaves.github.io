This is a compilation of amusing dedications and acknowledgments.

> I wish to thank Prof. Pavel Etingof and his co-authors for adding technical notes to my historical monograph. While they have made a commendable effort at a concise exposition, their notes, unfortunately, have grown in size and in the end occupied a better part of this volume. I hope the reader will forgive this preponderance of technicalities in what, in essence, is a history book.
> 
> - Slava Gerovitch, who wrote the historical interludes in *Introduction to Representation Theory* by Pavel Etingof et al.

> (I would thank the children, but frankly, they’ve been no help.)
>
> - Piper Harron, in her PhD thesis *The Equidistribution of Lattice Shapes of Rings of Integers of Cubic, Quartic, and Quintic Number Fields: an Artist’s Rendering*

> Finally I would like to thank the typist who did such a painstaking job of typing the manuscript, namely myself. In turn I would like to thank Jo-Ann Kane for pretending that having a husband who typed endlessly for an entire academic year was a normal way to live one's life.
>
> - Richard Kane, *The Homology of Hopf Spaces*

> To my wife, Laurel Van Leer, whose support is invaluable, and to my children, Chad and Aubrey, without whom this book would have been completed much sooner.
>
> - Charles Weibel, *An Introduction to Homological Algebra*
